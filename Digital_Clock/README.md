This is not just one digital clock but three different ones that show our current time in Berlin and the respective utc and pst times.
I am a gamer and game releases are usually shown in different times than european summer time that is why I have googled these times 
a lot in my life... So why not make a small programm so that I can always look them up without googling them.
